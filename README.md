# Lesson Materials

This repository is a comprehensive collection of all the materials used in our lessons. It's designed to provide students and participants with easy access to a wide range of resources, ensuring a seamless learning experience.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific lesson or topic. Inside each folder, you will find the following materials:

- **Presentation File:** A detailed presentation to guide you through the lesson. Please note that the presentation file is password-protected for security reasons.
- **Code Samples:** Practical code examples used during the lecture, allowing you to review and practice the concepts covered.
- **Self-study Materials:** This includes a `README.md` file in each folder, which contains links to additional resources, recommended readings, and exercises for further learning and practice.

## Accessing Presentation Files

The presentation files are an integral part of the learning process. However, to ensure the integrity and exclusivity of our materials, these files are password-protected. If you need to access these files and do not have the password, or if you have forgotten it, please reach out to Alexander Belenkov for assistance.
