### Packages useful to know:
- [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): A middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action, useful for asynchronous operations.
- [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga): An alternative to Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga uses ES6 generators to make asynchronous flows based on side-effects.
- [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect): A library for creating memoized, composable selector functions to efficiently compute derived data from the Redux store. (No need if using Redux Toolkit: [createSelector](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createselector/))
- [Redux-Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist): Allows you to save the Redux store in the local storage of your application, useful for persisting state across sessions. (Persistence and Rehydration: [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/persistence-and-rehydration))
- [Redux-Form](https://github.com/redux-form/redux-form): Manages form state in Redux, making it easy to create forms that are powered by Redux.
- [Immutable.js](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js): Provides persistent immutable data structures, which can enhance performance and predictability when used with Redux. (Immutable Update Patterns: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/usage/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns))
